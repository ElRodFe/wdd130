      <p>
        Is a traditional South American herbal drink. It is also known as chimarrão or cimarrón, it is consumed principally in Argentina, Uruguay, some parts in Chile, south Brazil and Paraguay.
        The English word comes from the French maté and the American Spanish mate, which means both mate and the vessel for drinking it, from the Quechua word mati for the calabash gourd used to make it. 
        Both the spellings "maté" and "mate" are used in English. The acute accent indicates that the word is pronounced with two syllables, like café (both maté and café are stressed on the first syllable in the UK), rather than like the one-syllable English word "mate". An acute accent is not used in the Spanish spelling, because the first syllable is stressed. The Yerba Mate Association of the Americas points out that, in Spanish, "maté" with the stress on the second syllable means "I killed".
        In Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as chimarrão, although the word mate and the expression "mate amargo" (bitter mate) are also used in Argentina and Uruguay. The Spanish cimarrón means "rough", "brute", or "barbarian", but is most widely understood to mean "feral", and is used in almost all of Latin America for domesticated animals that have become wild. The word was then used by the people who colonized the region of the Río de la Plata to describe the natives' rough and sour drink, drunk with no other ingredient to sweeten the taste.

      <h3>How it was born?</h3>
      <p>
        Mate has a strong cultural significance for both national identity and society. Yerba Mate is the national drink of Paraguay, where it is also consumed with either hot or ice cold water (called tereré); Argentina; and Uruguay. Drinking mate is a common social practice in all of the territory of Paraguay and parts of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, southern Chile, and eastern Bolivia. Throughout the Southern Cone, it is considered to be a tradition taken from the Paraguayan Guaraní and drank by the gauchos or vaqueros, terms commonly used to describe the old residents of the South American pampas, chacos, or Patagonian grasslands, found principally in parts of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southeastern Bolivia, southern Chile and southern Brazil.
A common friendly (and sometimes not so friendly) discussion is about from “where the mate is”, Argentinians will say is their traditional drink and that it was born because of them, Uruguayans and Paraguayans will same the same thing, but the truth is quite different…
Mate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaraní who live in what is now Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, and was also spread by the Tupí people who lived in neighbouring areas. After, it was commercialised to part of southern Brazil and northeast Argentina, mostly some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba-mate is Ilex paraguariensis. The consumption of yerba-mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Yerba Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata and from there to Peru and Chile.

      <h3>How to prepare it?</h3>
      <p>
        1-Fill a flask with hot water.
To make sure your mates have the right temperature, ensure that the water is neither boiling nor lukewarm. The ideal range is between 70º and 80ºC (158º - 176ºF).
2- Pour in the yerba and shake
When you’re pouring the dried leaves from the packet into the mate you need just the right amount; you don’t want the mate to overflow, but you don’t want it empty either. Using your eye as a guide (forget about using a measure), fill the recipient three quarters full, then cover it with your free hand, tip it upside down, give it a shake, and blow off the dust that sticks to your hand (remember this part otherwise you’ll stain the first thing you touch.)
3- Tilt, make a hollow and pour in the water
Now tilt the mate so that the yerba rests on one side, and slowly pour a little water into the space created. We restate that, in order to avoid burning the yerba and reducing its flavour, the water shouldn’t be boiling! Let it rest for a moment before moving on.
4- Place the bombilla
The bombilla is the metal straw used to drink the infusion and it should be placed into the moist area of the yerba where you poured the water. One practical tip: cover the mouthpiece with your thumb as you plunge it in; that way you’ll avoid failing the exam by blocking the bombilla with pieces of yerba.
5- Time to brew
Now we’re ready to start serving. Pour a little water each time and always in the same part of the mate where the bombilla is placed to make it last as long as possible. Note that the same person retains the duty of cebador, or brewer, throughout the round.
