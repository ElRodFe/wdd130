    <p> Hey! here i go... I'm 25 years old and maybe as yo can read, english is not my first language, this is because
        i am from Soriano-Uruguay a little country maybe you never heard about before.
    </p>
    <p> I actually live with my mom and my younger brother, and if you wonder the answer is no, I'm not married (not yet).
    </p>
    <p> More than a year ago i finished a degree in Bussiness Management in Uruguay and after it i started feeling i should 
        enroll BYU-Pathway, then i also felt i should study programming and software development and now here i am.
    </p>
    <p> I'm really excited for learning about web development and many other things, progrraming is wonderful!</p>
