                <h2>1- Fill a flask with hot water.</h2>
                <p>
                    To make sure your mates have the right temperature, ensure 
                    that the water is neither boiling nor lukewarm. The ideal range is 
                    between 70º and 80ºC (158º - 176ºF).

                <h2>2- Pour in the yerba and shake.</h2>
                <p>
                    When you’re pouring the dried leaves from the packet into the mate you need just 
                    the right amount; you don’t want the mate to overflow, but you don’t want it empty 
                    either. Using your eye as a guide (forget about using a measure), fill the 
                    recipient three quarters full, then cover it with your free hand, tip it upside 
                    down, give it a shake, and blow off the dust that sticks to your hand (remember 
                    this part otherwise you’ll stain the first thing you touch.)

                <h2>3- Tilt, make a hollow and pour in the water.</h2>
                <p>
                    Now tilt the mate so that the yerba rests on one side, and slowly pour a little 
                    water into the space created. We restate that, in order to avoid burning the yerba 
                    and reducing its flavour, the water shouldn’t be boiling! Let it rest for a moment 
                    before moving on.

            <section class="msg">
                <h2>4- Place the bombilla</h2>
                <p>
                    The bombilla is the metal straw used to drink the infusion and it should be placed 
                    into the moist area of the yerba where you poured the water. One practical tip: 
                    cover the mouthpiece with your thumb as you plunge it in; that way you’ll avoid 
                    failing the exam by blocking the bombilla with pieces of yerba.

                <p>
                    Now we’re ready to start serving. Pour a little water each time and always in the 
                    same part of the mate where the bombilla is placed to make it last as long as 
                    possible. Note that the same person retains the duty of cebador, or brewer, 
                    throughout the round.
